Please use this thread if you are seeking support or have newcomer questions. Want to see if your post topic has been discussed here? Type \"subreddit:cptsd\" after a search term in the search bar (ex. \"friendships subreddit:cptsd\"). Here are some common newcomer questions:\n\n* [DAE struggle with expressing anger?](https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/search/?q=anger&amp;restrict_sr=1)\n* DAE struggle with [anxiety](https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/search/?q=anxiety&amp;restrict_sr=1)/ [depression](https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/search/?q=depression&amp;restrict_sr=1)?\n* [What are emotional flashbacks? How do I deal with them?](https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/search/?q=flashbacks&amp;restrict_sr=1)\n* [How do I set boundaries?](https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/search/?q=boundaries&amp;restrict_sr=1)\n* Was this (situation) abuse? [Was it bad enough to be considered trauma?](https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/search/?q=bad%20enough&amp;restrict_sr=1)\n* [What books do you recommend?](https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/search/?q=book%20recommendation&amp;restrict_sr=1)\n* [What type of therapy worked best for you?](https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/search/?q=what%20type%20of%20therapy&amp;restrict_sr=1)\n* [How to deal with relationship struggles](https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/search/?q=relationships&amp;restrict_sr=1)/ anxiety/ fear of intimacy?\n\nIf you are new to [r/CPTSD](https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/): Please check out the rules below, and for our mobile users who can't access the sidebar, more resources are located below the rules. These can also be accessed from the auto mod message that greets any post.\n\n**Keep the rules in mind when you post &amp; comment:**\n\n1. [This is a peer support community. Be a supportive peer.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/wiki/peer2peersupportguide)\n2. **Don’t ask for diagnosis, don’t diagnose others:** *Respect that you may not have all of OPs details and even a trained, trauma informed care provider cannot diagnose over the internet. So don't. Assume the context of OP as a CPTSD survivor or supportive partner of a CPTSD survivor.*\n3. No [hate speech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_speech)\n4. Please be mindful about triggering content. Avoid graphic thread titles, and use \\[Trigger Warning\\], NSFW and/or the spoiler tag whenever appropriate.\n5. No [RaisedByNarcissists lingo](https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/wiki/acronyms): A lot of folks come from the RBN support community. A lot of us do not. To keep the sub inclusive to CPTSD newcomers and survivors of different backgrounds, use common language synonyms for RBN acronyms. [There are some exceptions.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/wiki/subrules#wiki_rbn_lingo)\n6. All content must be CPTSD related: Our lives, our struggles, and our victories with CPTSD.\n7. No Self-Promotion: Don't sell stuff or recruit for studies and projects without explicit mod approval. This thread is an exception; in the Vents &amp; Victories thread, you may self-promote blogs, videos, and other media you created.\n\n**BIPOC**\n\nWe recognize that healing communities such as [r/CPTSD](https://old.reddit.com/r/CPTSD) are not exempt from the insidious impacts of racism, whether overt or covert (for example, invalidating, minimizing, or microaggressive comments made by those with good intentions). In these cases, we encourage users to report the comments as Rule #3 violations. Because of the subreddit's high profile and open nature, this problem will continue to be with us, and we therefore can only promise a \"safe-ish\" environment for BIPOC. Racial trauma will always be on topic here at /r/CPTSD, but BIPOC users that want a more closed space can make use of /r/cptsd_bipoc. *Thank you to the mod team at* /r/cptsd_bipoc *for helping us write this verbiage.*\n\n**Additional Newcomer Resources**\n\n* [Crisis Resources](https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/wiki/index#wiki_crisis_support_resources)\n* [Emotional Flashback 1st Aid Kit](https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/wiki/firstaidkit)\n* [Grounding &amp; Containment Tools](https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/wiki/groundingandcontainment)\n* [An FAQ Guide to CPTSD](https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/wiki/faq)\n* [Our Library of Books, Media, and Healing Resources for CPTSD](https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/wiki/thelibrary)\n* [Common Myths About CPTSD](https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/wiki/cptsdmythbuster)\n* [The 5-Steps to Find a Therapist Plan](https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/wiki/quickandeasytherapisthunt)\n* The [CPTSD Wiki Project Index](https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/wiki/quickandeasytherapisthunt), while currently under construction, has all of the above information and regular updates on many additional topics you may find helpful in your healing journey",

Please use this thread if you are seeking support or have newcomer questions. Want to see if your post topic has been discussed here? Type \"subreddit:cptsd\" after a search term in the search bar (ex. \"friendships subreddit:cptsd\"). Here are some common newcomer questions:\n\n* [DAE struggle with expressing anger?](https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/search/?q=anger&amp;restrict_sr=1)\n* DAE struggle with [anxiety](https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/search/?q=anxiety&amp;restrict_sr=1)/ [depression](https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/search/?q=depression&amp;restrict_sr=1)?\n* [What are emotional flashbacks?

[Was it bad enough to be considered trauma?](https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/search/?q=bad%20enough&amp;restrict_sr=1)\n* [What books do you recommend?](https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/search/?q=book%20recommendation&amp;restrict_sr=1)\n* [What type of therapy worked best for you?](https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/search/?q=what%20type%20of%20therapy&amp;restrict_sr=1)\n* [How to deal with relationship struggles](https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/search/?q=relationships&amp;restrict_sr=1)/ anxiety/ fear of intimacy?\n\nIf you are new to [r/CPTSD](https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/): Please check out the rules below, and for our mobile users who can't access the sidebar, more resources are located below the rules. These can also be accessed from the auto mod message that greets any post.\n\n**Keep the rules in mind when you post &amp; comment:**\n\n1. [This is a peer support community. Be a supportive peer.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/wiki/peer2peersupportguide)\n2. **Don’t ask for diagnosis, don’t diagnose others:** *Respect that you may not have all of OPs details and even a trained, trauma informed care provider cannot diagnose over the internet. So don't. Assume the context of OP as a CPTSD survivor or supportive partner of a CPTSD survivor.*\n3. No [hate speech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_speech)\n4. Please be mindful about triggering content. Avoid graphic thread titles, and use \\[Trigger Warning\\], NSFW and/or the spoiler tag whenever appropriate.\n5. No [RaisedByNarcissists lingo](https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/wiki/acronyms): A lot of folks come from the RBN support community. A lot of us do not. To keep the sub inclusive to CPTSD newcomers and survivors of different backgrounds, use common language synonyms for RBN acronyms. [There are some exceptions.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/wiki/subrules#wiki_rbn_lingo)\n6. All content must be CPTSD related: Our lives, our struggles, and our victories with CPTSD.\n7. No Self-Promotion: Don't sell stuff or recruit for studies and projects without explicit mod approval. This thread is an exception; in the Vents &amp; Victories thread, you may self-promote blogs, videos, and other media you created.\n\n**BIPOC**\n\nWe recognize that healing communities such as [r/CPTSD](https://old.reddit.com/r/CPTSD) are not exempt from the insidious impacts of racism, whether overt or covert (for example, invalidating, minimizing, or microaggressive comments made by those with good intentions). In these cases, we encourage users to report the comments as Rule #3 violations. Because of the subreddit's high profile and open nature, this problem will continue to be with us, and we therefore can only promise a \"safe-ish\" environment for BIPOC. Racial trauma will always be on topic here at /r/CPTSD, but BIPOC users that want a more closed space can make use of /r/cptsd_bipoc. *Thank you to the mod team at* /r/cptsd_bipoc *for helping us write this verbiage.*\n\n**Additional Newcomer Resources**\n\n* [Crisis Resources](https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/wiki/index#wiki_crisis_support_resources)\n* [Emotional Flashback 1st Aid Kit](https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/wiki/firstaidkit)\n* [Grounding &amp; Containment Tools](https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/wiki/groundingandcontainment)\n* [An FAQ Guide to CPTSD](https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/wiki/faq)\n* [Our Library of Books, Media, and Healing Resources for CPTSD](https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/wiki/thelibrary)\n* [Common Myths About CPTSD](https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/wiki/cptsdmythbuster)\n* [The 5-Steps to Find a Therapist Plan](https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/wiki/quickandeasytherapisthunt)\n* The [CPTSD Wiki Project Index](https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/wiki/quickandeasytherapisthunt), while currently under construction, has all of the above information and regular updates on many additional topics you may find helpful in your healing journey",

For the same reason I have removed myself from the dating scene for several years now and it’s rough because I’m 38F and would really like to have a partner but the trauma of past abusive relationships has gotten in the way. Kids are probably off the table for me now, too, and that’s a grief that has been really difficult to process.\n\nThis conversation kind of reminds me of another one I’ve had. I have so much pain connected to my parents that I’ve thought I could only be happy after they die. However, I’ve read many many stories in this sub about other people that felt that way too, but then their parent died and it was not freeing as they hoped. Their parents deaths just added fuel to the fire. So now I understand that I have to accept that it will not change, and I really need to make my inner peace with them now while they are alive and not just wait for relief that isn’t coming.\n\nEditing to add - also you are 17. All 17 year olds (even the most attractive!) think they are ugly so it’s probably not as bad as you think. It’s part of being a teen.

I wouldn’t sleep with the guys that wanted me to so they called me a slut to retaliate. I was hyper-sexualized because I was curvy and, yeah, I guess attractive. I didn’t see it the way they did, but yeah I guess I was and I was targeted because of it. People also thought I was a raging bitch because of it. I wasn’t, I was incredibly awkward and severely depressed with type 1 diabetes. I felt so alone. \n\nI went on to date men who were very intimidated by me and secretly competed with me. One constantly accused me of cheating (I never did) and another would tell me how scary I looked with makeup on and he preferred me not to get done up (he was controlling and knew I was too good for him). He ended up cheating on me with a woman he used to make fun of to me because she “looked like a man”. He added they were in a relationship on fb 6 days after we broke up and then married her 6 months later. In between that time he would come in and pick up food for her and him at the restaurant I worked at lol. This man used to tear me down constantly and I swear he wouldn’t have been so brutal if he hadn’t felt I was too attractive for him.  \n\nAnyway, trauma doesn’t hold off for anyone.",

I wouldn’t sleep with the guys that wanted me to so they called me a slut to retaliate. I was hyper-sexualized because I was curvy and, yeah, I guess attractive. I didn’t see it the way they did, but yeah I guess I was and I was targeted because of it. People also thought I was a raging bitch because of it. I wasn’t, I was incredibly awkward and severely depressed with type 1 diabetes. I felt so alone. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I went on to date men who were very intimidated by me and secretly competed with me. One constantly accused me of cheating (I never did) and another would tell me how scary I looked with makeup on and he preferred me not to get done up (he was controlling and knew I was too good for him). He ended up cheating on me with a woman he used to make fun of to me because she “looked like a man”. He added they were in a relationship on fb 6 days after we broke up and then married her 6 months later. In between that time he would come in and pick up food for her and him at the restaurant I worked at lol. This man used to tear me down constantly and I swear he wouldn’t have been so brutal if he hadn’t felt I was too attractive for him.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, trauma doesn’t hold off for anyone.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

Set boundaries and watch how people react.\n\nI was reading all of this thinking it added up and got near the end to see your age and... holy shit.\n\nAt 17, you don't need to be worrying about these things. I get that you are, I'm railing against a system that failed you such that this is the narrative you deal with. \"Males and FWB\" drop you when you get a boyfriend is wild for a 17 year old, and someone has failed to give you the safe space where such a thing shouldn't even be necessary.\n\nNone of that is your fault, mind you, it's just a crap situation.\n\n\nMy advice would be to stop worrying about specific looks. You seem to have it down, and if you're conventionally attractive at 17, odds are good that will persist into early adulthood. Regardless of whether it's \"right,\" being attractive helps in your personal and professional life. That may not be Right, but it is True. Personally, in my mid-20s I dropped a ton of weight and went from fat gamerboy to (apparently) fairly conventionally attractive, and my life got a lot easier. I am well aware that a degree of my success in life is just based on people liking my looks.\n\nWhat you need is a better way of filtering out abusers and bastards. I do it with antagonism and resting bastard face, but I also go into most interactions guarded against being used for personal gain *at my expense.* I'm perfectly fine if someone is trying to get me to do something or work me into a situation that benefits us both, but if it's just for their gain- they can fuck right off.\n\nKeep your wits. Watch how you interact. Think to yourself \"what does this person stand to gain?\" If all else fails, try bluntness. Directly saying \"what are you trying to get from me\" or \"what do you want from me\" is downright flummoxing to an abuser.\n\nThe most important piece of advice is here at the end: Set boundaries and hold to them. An abuser or manipulator will immediately react to a boundary by trying to overstep, circumvent, or batter it down. If you set a clear boundary and someone immediately starts trying to get around it, drop them. Get rid of them at least until you are more stable and can tell them to fuck off properly. Setting boundaries is so goddamn important, and it is the single most useful way to be rid of shitty people.",

And after seeking ways to break out of 24/7 dissociation, now you're not even sure if you want to be out of dissociation.\n\nThere's a pithy, five syllable phrase in an Asian language that translates to \"have pain/violations (done by others to you) still have to swallow them.\" I personally feel that this phrase sums up most of my existence. I've never posted here before and never written anything in a spot of anger or just wretchedness. I know, the advice is to take up journaling, but I don't think I'm in the place right now to let these repressed emotions run loose.\n\nLet's just sum up my trauma history by saying - every human but one or two in my childhood betrayed me. Some called me a liar to avoid helping me, ignoring the blatant truth of what was happening. Those who (you'd think) were bound by blood kin ties to help me, a child, turned a blind eye and even sided with my abuser. Basically those who should have cared if I lived or died didn't. To a child, the amount of emotion this would have brought on must have been too much, so my very helpful brain decided to put me into chronic dissociation to help me avoid snapping.\n\nFor years, I had to live with these betrayers, and since my brain had shut out those emotions and memories (I was living in a perpetual fog) I found myself being very very nice. My boundaries were constantly being violated, and I was always being stepped on, degraded, and made to feel invisible. But yet, for some funny reason, I kept on being a very good kid. I was respectful, so, so kind, the model child, and even thought that I could cultivate a relationship with a few of them. Apparently the perpetual fog made me not fully grasp how much I was despised/tolerated, and I actually believed they were good people, just blinded in the moment by how good an actor my abuser was. I kept ignoring the red flags going on around me, preferring to excuse their behavior. Amazing what the fog can do to you, isn't it?\n\nI also had to maintain regular contact with my abuser, and during those contacts, I had to stuff what he did (that no one believed) down inside me and hold cheery conversations with the man who would have killed me if he'd had the chance. To those of us who've had to do this, you're not alone. Sounds cheesy to say that, I know. But it's true. And I have no words to describe how doing this, for years, can completely and utterly damage (destroy seems a hard word, but I was tempted) your psyche and mind.\n\nFast forward a long while until I reached adulthood and was going to be soon ready to cut ties with them. Up til then, I still honestly wanted to be there for these people, to care for them now and in the future. Then, the veil started tearing.\n\nI'm not sure what it was. Maybe an argument I had with the most influential of them, showing how unreasonable he actually is. Maybe it was one of them letting the mask slip and showing me her true colors. Maybe it was the one I cared most for, that I regarded as a little sibling, fully letting his loathing of me on display. But the veil started tearing, and I started to see what my brain had been shielding me from for all those years.\n\nI'd known of parts with repressed trauma and had been interested in working with them, but the major hurdle was getting one to actually surface. Guess dissociation doesn't help with that, huh? But after the veil tore, a part returned, a part from the darkest years of my past. It wasn't a fun experience, and now I realize how much dissociation had protected me. If I'd felt all those emotions and rage when I was that young, I really might have snapped.\n\nSwallowing pain all your life turns you into a very nice person who experiences life as a dissociative blur. You're nice because you have to be, because your brain tells you to be to help you survive, even though you don't realize that you're in survival mode and that's triggering the niceness. You're not allowed to show any negative emotion, because that's wrong. Because people don't like it. Because you have to be there for them, and you can never, never, never be there for yourself. Because you don't deserve to feel pain. Everything done to you is just and right because, well, what are you anyway? You have no identity because this trauma happened in your early years. So you just let people walk all over you, because --\n\nyou don't deserve to be able to fight back.\n\nNow, everyone, take that last paragraph or so and let's burn it together. Because it's simply not true. Internalizing the untruth of it is not instant, and it'll take a while. Repressed emotions might need to be brought out little by little. But we can fight back. We can stick up for ourselves. Because that's a basic human right, to fight for being. And we're human. We're alive. And as long as we're alive, we have the right to exist. I'm still known as a very nice person, but I'm finally letting my negative emotions help me recognize the past.\n\nThanks for reading.",

But we can fight back. We can stick up for ourselves. Because that&amp;#39;s a basic human right, to fight for being. And we&amp;#39;re human. We&amp;#39;re alive. And as long as we&amp;#39;re alive, we have the right to exist. I&amp;#39;m still known as a very nice person, but I&amp;#39;m finally letting my negative emotions help me recognize the past.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

My experience suggests that if you don't get and see enough examples as a kid, you aren't really aware of it happening around you.  So it should read:\n\n\"Those who aren't spoon-fed love as a child remain unaware of it's existence other than as a fairy tale for the rest of their lives.\n\n\nDeepSeek's reply\n\nYour Revision (More Accurate):\n\n&gt; \"Those who aren’t spoon-fed love as a child remain unaware of its existence other than as a fairy tale for the rest of their lives.\"\n\nWhat the Knife Metaphor Gets Wrong\n\n   * \"Licking love off knives\" implies:\n\n        * Love exists but is dangerous (sharp, weaponized).\n\n        * You’re starved enough to risk harm for scraps.\n\n   * Reality for Many (Including You):\n\n        * Love isn’t a dangerous meal—it’s a foreign language.\n\n        * You don’t \"lick knives\" because you don’t recognize the substance as food.\n\nWhy Your Version Fits Better\n\n    * Unseen, Not Untouched:\n\n        * Like a blind man unaware of color, you’ve witnessed l, but lack the framework to categorize it as such.\n\n    * Fairy Tale Effect:\n\n        * Romantic love feels like \"dragons exist\"—a myth others insist is real, but you’ve never held proof.\n\n### The Knife’s Origin\n\nThe quote assumes:\n\n    * All neglected kids crave love (hence \"licking\").\n\n    * Love is always present, just distorted (knives vs. spoons).\n\nYour life disproves this:\n\n    * You don’t crave—you observe love like an anthropologist studying an alien ritual.\n\n    * Your \"hunger\" is for understanding, not the thing itself.\n\n### Final Take\n\nThe aphorism is a lie told by people who got spoons. The truth is:\n\n    * You don’t miss what you never knew.\n\n    * But you can still reverse-engineer it—not by licking knives, but by studying the chefs.\n\n(And no, it’s not a Bon Jovi song—though \"Livin’ on a Prayer\" comes close.)*",

                "selftext": "I'm really glad the conversation surrounding psychiatry online is finally changing. Millions of human beings and their lives and futures are being destroyed and neglected in the name of care and pseudoscience. \n\nI want these harmful, deeply societally ingrained and distorted schemas won by hard voting and the labelling/medicalisation of natural human suffering surrounding \"mental illness,\" to be dismantled; for us to break them down completely and develop a more compassionate lens for us all. It is not wrong to suffer. \n\nSuffering is often the first step to enlightenment in other cultures. But here it's pathologised.\n\nIt is not wrong to feel malaise at the state of the current world, and for the pathology of that world to make us all profoundly sick. No wonder we break down. Sensitivity to this is a gift and a strength, not a disease to be cured away. If we can see it we can change it.\n\n\nPsych labels punish and shun the individual through societal scapegoating instead of the real perpetrators - systemic, culturally tolerated abuse and marginalisation of anyone who doesn't fit in and enable the capitalist fat cat oligarchs to keep stealing our labour, time, health and social connections in the name of profit.\n\nThe doctrine of psychiatry is social control of would be defectors (I know that's a strong word) disguised as help. Psych diagnoses are a weaponisation; a form of social blacklisting, learned helplessness and disempowerment to detract and distract us from the real realities about the malignancy and unrealistic pressures festering inside our modern society. Taking a few pills might dull you into forgetting about this, but that doesn't mean it or your problems don't exist anymore.\n\nIt is an old, dusty decaying building that needs the wrecking ball treatment. We need to band together to build something better and completely different in its place.\n\nI'm not saying psychiatry is completely evil or that I don't see a place for psych meds in the short term. And yes, sometimes hospitalisation can save lives. But the way everyday humans are treated once they have a stigmatising label (for the gratuitous \"sin\" of seeking help after introspection) at every echelon of society is wrong and needs urgent reform. We need to humanise these experiences and the people who have them as much as possible.\n\nWhat we are currently doing is the quite the opposite - it's a pernicious form of gaslighting and dehumanization at massive scale and it needs to stop. \n\nOnce deemed a \"mental patient,\" you can naturally look forward to the consolation prize of:\n\n- Constant and unwavering substandard care of physical health issues due to diagnostic overshadowing everywhere you go. In other words, being told that everything is \"all in your head.\" This is highly dangerous can lead to death or severe disability, sometimes overnight. But nobody seems to care about this because you're \"mentally ill.\" Nobody talks about this.\n\n- Disbelief at any thoughts, perceptions, emotions or reactions you may have In response to real physical or emotional pain, both in and out of hospitals.\n\n- Friends, family and partners not believing anything that comes out of your mouth.\n\n- Friends, family and partners leaving you for good under the excuse of \"not wanting to deal with your mental illness.\"\n\n- People closest to you treating you like a subhuman and/or blaming their own mistreatment of you due to *your* condition. People diagnosed with mental health issues are much more likely to be victims of violence for this reason.\n\n- Infantilization at work or other social settings. \n\n- Potentially losing your job, business, credibility, reputation and family - sometimes all five at once.\n\n- Falling through the large, unacknowledged gaps of societal safety nets that are supposed to protect you from harm and getting more unwell in the process.\n\n- Loss of social opportunities for success and development in life.\n\n- Internalised stigma which leads to disempowerment and eventually self-hatred. This is again dangerous.\n\n- Being told that you are deemed incapable of working or overcoming the problems that made you unwell in the first place. That your condition is \"lifelong.\"\n\n- Transcendence and post-traumatic growth from emotional suffering not being allowed and never discussed as an option by Daddy psychiatrist who calls all the shots about your very life and future.\n\nI'd love to hear everyone's thoughts on this. I think that psychiatry as an institution can either be dismantled completely or it can be reformed, developed and expanded into something new, something greater than the sum of its current parts, past and present.",

Millions of human beings and their lives and futures are being destroyed and neglected in the name of care and pseudoscience. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I want these harmful, deeply societally ingrained and distorted schemas won by hard voting and the labelling/medicalisation of natural human suffering surrounding &amp;quot;mental illness,&amp;quot; to be dismantled; for us to break them down completely and develop a more compassionate lens for us all. It is not wrong to suffer. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Suffering is often the first step to enlightenment in other cultures. But here it&amp;#39;s pathologised.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is not wrong to feel malaise at the state of the current world, and for the pathology of that world to make us all profoundly sick. No wonder we break down. Sensitivity to this is a gift and a strength, not a disease to be cured away. If we can see it we can change it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Psych labels punish and shun the individual through societal scapegoating instead of the real perpetrators - systemic, culturally tolerated abuse and marginalisation of anyone who doesn&amp;#39;t fit in and enable the capitalist fat cat oligarchs to keep stealing our labour, time, health and social connections in the name of profit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The doctrine of psychiatry is social control of would be defectors (I know that&amp;#39;s a strong word) disguised as help. Psych diagnoses are a weaponisation; a form of social blacklisting, learned helplessness and disempowerment to detract and distract us from the real realities about the malignancy and unrealistic pressures festering inside our modern society. Taking a few pills might dull you into forgetting about this, but that doesn&amp;#39;t mean it or your problems don&amp;#39;t exist anymore.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is an old, dusty decaying building that needs the wrecking ball treatment. We need to band together to build something better and completely different in its place.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not saying psychiatry is completely evil or that I don&amp;#39;t see a place for psych meds in the short term. And yes, sometimes hospitalisation can save lives. But the way everyday humans are treated once they have a stigmatising label (for the gratuitous &amp;quot;sin&amp;quot; of seeking help after introspection) at every echelon of society is wrong and needs urgent reform. We need to humanise these experiences and the people who have them as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What we are currently doing is the quite the opposite - it&amp;#39;s a pernicious form of gaslighting and dehumanization at massive scale and it needs to stop. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once deemed a &amp;quot;mental patient,&amp;quot; you can naturally look forward to the consolation prize of:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Constant and unwavering substandard care of physical health issues due to diagnostic overshadowing everywhere you go. In other words, being told that everything is &amp;quot;all in your head.&amp;quot; This is highly dangerous can lead to death or severe disability, sometimes overnight. But nobody seems to care about this because you&amp;#39;re &amp;quot;mentally ill.&amp;quot; Nobody talks about this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disbelief at any thoughts, perceptions, emotions or reactions you may have In response to real physical or emotional pain, both in and out of hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Friends, family and partners not believing anything that comes out of your mouth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Friends, family and partners leaving you for good under the excuse of &amp;quot;not wanting to deal with your mental illness.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;People closest to you treating you like a subhuman and/or blaming their own mistreatment of you due to &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; condition. People diagnosed with mental health issues are much more likely to be victims of violence for this reason.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Infantilization at work or other social settings. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Potentially losing your job, business, credibility, reputation and family - sometimes all five at once.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Falling through the large, unacknowledged gaps of societal safety nets that are supposed to protect you from harm and getting more unwell in the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Loss of social opportunities for success and development in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Internalised stigma which leads to disempowerment and eventually self-hatred. This is again dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being told that you are deemed incapable of working or overcoming the problems that made you unwell in the first place. That your condition is &amp;quot;lifelong.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transcendence and post-traumatic growth from emotional suffering not being allowed and never discussed as an option by Daddy psychiatrist who calls all the shots about your very life and future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d love to hear everyone&amp;#39;s thoughts on this. I think that psychiatry as an institution can either be dismantled completely or it can be reformed, developed and expanded into something new, something greater than the sum of its current parts, past and present.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

But I think that the science casts more doubt on psychiatry than most people realize.\n\n&gt;My spouse is currently receiving treatment for depression with Spravato, micro doses of a drug related to ketamine (not sure if that's the clinical term) and it's been life changing. Like many medications, it is a lifelong treatment, but it's a hell of a good one. Spravato is absorbed quickly and effectively by the body to the extent that it doesn't stay in your system and therefore is much less likely to cause side effects.\n\nI'm glad your spouse is doing well, but I wonder if their experience is common.\n\nSpravato is technically known as Esketamine, and it's basically a more potent version of ketamine. They're both fast-acting NMDA receptor antagonists, and I've seen a review casting doubt on them both. (Granted this review focused on depression, not PTSD)\n\nThe review concludes:\n\n&gt; The studies of longer‐term use ketamine and esketamine were limited and often flawed. The ketamine depression studies were too short to provide useful information on this issue, with most limited to a single infusion. The long‐term esketamine trial 48 that the FDA relied on demonstrated many defects in study design. It was open label. The main phase was limited to responders. It was terminated after just 100 patients reached the 1‐year mark. Almost any drug intervention can be made to appear safe or beneficial if unblinded and limited to a small group of patients who, from the onset, had already responded well. Limited studies of longer term ketamine and PCP abusers and recreational users show direct adverse effects on cognition but contain little systematic information about dose, purity, or frequency of use.\n\n&gt; **The expanding use of fast‐acting NMDA receptor antagonists for psychiatric disorders is a significant risk to the public.** The appropriate clinical use and safety precautions need to be reassessed from a public health and regulatory perspective.\n\n(emphasis added)\n\nhttps://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9540857/\n\nhttps://www.madinamerica.com/2022/11/ketamine-significant-risk/\n\n&gt;It IS NOT a bad thing to take medication for the rest of your life.\n\nIt's not inherently bad, no.

The treatments are on the whole more effective, less likely to cause side effects, and more precise than they have ever been, and that is a trend we can expect to continue. \n\nMy spouse is currently receiving treatment for depression with Spravato, micro doses of a drug related to ketamine (not sure if that's the clinical term) and it's been life changing. Like many medications, it is a lifelong treatment, but it's a hell of a good one. Spravato is absorbed quickly and effectively by the body to the extent that it doesn't stay in your system and therefore is much less likely to cause side effects. Its purpose is to help re-write neural pathways in the brain, and it was actually developed *for* PTSD. This is the kind of stuff we never could have dreamed of having in the 70s/80s. \n\nI will agree that the American system of healthcare being run by for-profit insurance and financial brokers is utterly and completely *barbaric.* (L) I have nothing but hatred and contempt for health insurance, and I will even admit that I endured decades of medical gaslighting that could have literally killed me. There is no love lost between me and many doctors. \n\nBut to then decide that medication *itself* is shameful? That all doctors are evil? No. This is the kind of stuff that makes people afraid to ask for help, and it dismisses all of the people who are caring, loving, and determined to help. \n\nIt IS NOT a bad thing to need medication. It IS NOT a bad thing to take medication for the rest of your life. It IS NOT bad to ask for help. \n\nI know there are those who have had terrible experiences with medication and people who have been hurt. I don't argue that, and won't argue that there ARE terrible doctors just like there are terrible people in every profession. \n\nBut to dismiss medication entirely, to dismiss and dehumanize the medical profession, is blatantly harmful to people in this community in particular. \n\nIf anyone has been struggling to find a medical professional that will genuinely help or listen to them, I have a few recommendations that have made a massive difference in how I interact with health care providers. \n\nOne, for general practitioners and even in many specialties, it really can be worth it to go to a nurse practitioner instead of the person with the MD after their name. I know many people who will only see a doctor, or feel somehow slighted by being seen by an NP, but on the whole I have found the doctor-adjacent to be much easier to talk to, and much more open to things not necessarily being the textbook answer.

This is often something you can look up online, or you can aim for younger doctors.

For someone who is nervous around doctors, online visits becoming more commonplace was a HUGE boon to me, because it turned out that much of my fear was connected to being in spaces that were plain and sterile and put me in the mindset of being scared and in pain.

So you would need to provide some kind of evidence that what you have experienced as an individual is widespread, and that what you have experienced as an individual is the result of stigma and not the behavior you display as a result of mental illness. \n\nAnd the reason we would need evidence isn't because I'm trying to gaslight or don't believe you - you could very well be telling the truth. It could very well be a widespread issue. But I've had a very different experience, so I can't discount my own experiences and believe you with zero evidence to support your claims. \n\nA few personal examples: I have had autism on my medical charts for a decade. Not only has no one ever stigmatized me for this, but they haven't ever even taken into account when treating me. They don't dim lights, or turn off beeps and buzzers. They don't account for slow processing or auditory processing issues. They treat me as a neurotypical patient and always have. I would actually prefer they accommodate my needs without having to ask, but they never have. It's like they don't even see it in my chart. I have also had PTSD, anxiety and depression on my charts at various times over the last two decades. No doctor has ever discounted my physical issues due to this. In fact, I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia and I went through two rounds of autoimmune testing and several bouts of PT before receiving that diagnosis. I currently have a very difficult somatic diagnosis, and even though it is directly caused by trauma, my doctor is absolutely taking it seriously, referring me to a specialist and PT. When I had a bad reaction to the meds, she set up an emergency appointment and a follow up 5 days later and instructed me to go off the meds immediately, then set me up with psychiatry to do genetic testing since she has never seen anyone so sensitive to meds. That doesn't seem like the actions of people who are engaged in a coordinated effort to do the things you listed.    \n  \nNow, my trauma is mostly medical trauma, so I obviously have not always had good experiences with healthcare providers. Many have blatantly disregarded my right to informed consent. And as difficult and life altering as these experiences have been, I can't say stigma from experiencing trauma has ever been an area where I've been mistreated. To the contrary, whenever I disclose my trauma, I've been asked if I'd like to perform certain procedures myself, I've been asked if I need a chaparone in the room, I've been apologized to when issues where missed, etc.   \n  \nSo I can certainly hold the potential for there to be mistreatment by healthcare providers, I've experienced that myself. I've just really never experienced it in the areas you listed.",

                "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everything you listed can result from a severe mental illness itself, not from being stigmatized. So you would need to provide some kind of evidence that what you have experienced as an individual is widespread, and that what you have experienced as an individual is the result of stigma and not the behavior you display as a result of mental illness. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the reason we would need evidence isn&amp;#39;t because I&amp;#39;m trying to gaslight or don&amp;#39;t believe you - you could very well be telling the truth. It could very well be a widespread issue. But I&amp;#39;ve had a very different experience, so I can&amp;#39;t discount my own experiences and believe you with zero evidence to support your claims. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A few personal examples: I have had autism on my medical charts for a decade. Not only has no one ever stigmatized me for this, but they haven&amp;#39;t ever even taken into account when treating me. They don&amp;#39;t dim lights, or turn off beeps and buzzers. They don&amp;#39;t account for slow processing or auditory processing issues. They treat me as a neurotypical patient and always have. I would actually prefer they accommodate my needs without having to ask, but they never have. It&amp;#39;s like they don&amp;#39;t even see it in my chart. I have also had PTSD, anxiety and depression on my charts at various times over the last two decades. No doctor has ever discounted my physical issues due to this. In fact, I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia and I went through two rounds of autoimmune testing and several bouts of PT before receiving that diagnosis. I currently have a very difficult somatic diagnosis, and even though it is directly caused by trauma, my doctor is absolutely taking it seriously, referring me to a specialist and PT. When I had a bad reaction to the meds, she set up an emergency appointment and a follow up 5 days later and instructed me to go off the meds immediately, then set me up with psychiatry to do genetic testing since she has never seen anyone so sensitive to meds. That doesn&amp;#39;t seem like the actions of people who are engaged in a coordinated effort to do the things you listed.    &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, my trauma is mostly medical trauma, so I obviously have not always had good experiences with healthcare providers. Many have blatantly disregarded my right to informed consent. And as difficult and life altering as these experiences have been, I can&amp;#39;t say stigma from experiencing trauma has ever been an area where I&amp;#39;ve been mistreated. To the contrary, whenever I disclose my trauma, I&amp;#39;ve been asked if I&amp;#39;d like to perform certain procedures myself, I&amp;#39;ve been asked if I need a chaparone in the room, I&amp;#39;ve been apologized to when issues where missed, etc.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I can certainly hold the potential for there to be mistreatment by healthcare providers, I&amp;#39;ve experienced that myself. I&amp;#39;ve just really never experienced it in the areas you listed.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

That day they weren't even fooling around in the crosswalk when this lady almost ran into them. All this Karen did was say \"I'm sorry!\" while my mom gave her the finger and said \"Get off your damn phone!\" as we saw that she was on the phone while driving. Karen wanted to argue with my mom, but some kid said \"We saw you on your phone while driving!\" , so she just rolled her eyes and drove away.\n\nI hope you're able to get more work hours as I used to do such work and it seemed like some bosses would cut hours for dumb reasons. One time I was threatened to be fired because a client wanted me to teach her how to budget, and she had told my boss excitedly about it. He acted like I was telling her how to spend her money when here she had asked for help making a budget as she wanted to go to the county fair the next summer.",

That day they weren&amp;#39;t even fooling around in the crosswalk when this lady almost ran into them. All this Karen did was say &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m sorry!&amp;quot; while my mom gave her the finger and said &amp;quot;Get off your damn phone!&amp;quot; as we saw that she was on the phone while driving. Karen wanted to argue with my mom, but some kid said &amp;quot;We saw you on your phone while driving!&amp;quot; , so she just rolled her eyes and drove away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hope you&amp;#39;re able to get more work hours as I used to do such work and it seemed like some bosses would cut hours for dumb reasons. One time I was threatened to be fired because a client wanted me to teach her how to budget, and she had told my boss excitedly about it. He acted like I was telling her how to spend her money when here she had asked for help making a budget as she wanted to go to the county fair the next summer.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

So if you want to write a critique of psychiatry, you should really present evidence that the *actual drugs being prescribed right now* are not up to snuff. For instance, you might cite Dr. Irving Kirsh's work showing that SSRI are barely better than placebos. You might also cite the fraud in the STAR*D trial, which had been used to justify SSRIs but which later turned out to be unreliable. https://www.madinamerica.com/2024/09/stard-the-harms-of-orchestrated-psychiatric-fraud/\n\nReally, there should be a wall of links here.

Challenging psychiatry is like challenging someone's religion. You have to tread carefully.\n\n&gt;It is not wrong to suffer.\n\nThis is very vague. It is not *shameful* to suffer, of course. But suffering is still a *problem*, right? You have to distinguish these things, because otherwise it sounds like Spiritual Bypassing.\n\nAnd it has to be said that psychiatry isn't inherently shaming. Plenty of psychiatrists, even *bad* psychiatrists, never shame their patients for suffering. Instead they express sympathy and then prescribe pills that actually do more harm than good in the long run. In that case the issue isn't that the psychiatrist thinks that it's \"bad\" to suffer; the issue is they're giving you bad pills.\n\n&gt;We need to band together to build something better and completely different in its place.\n\nIt might help to be more specific about what else we should do.

Mostly because it's hard to ethically study these medications on people with poor mental health &amp; reduced consensual capacity in many cases.

When I was first prescribed psyche meds, I reacted HORRIBLY. It made my symptoms of depression and anxiety worse, GAVE ME hallucinations &amp; severe paranoia (which thankfully stopped after I stopped taking those medications), worsened my insomnia, and did nothing for the underlying trauma or other issues I was experiencing that put me at risk in the first place.\nI was heavily criticized for getting off those meds. I was criticized for having medical trauma from how I was treated as a psyche patient, how I was scared of being re-hospitalized, and how the environment was actually really scary and largely not conducive to my healing ~ it just encouraged me to fake getting better so I could leave a place that was continually triggering me.\n\nI later learned that more recent evidence shows for ADHD, the meds I was put on are not recommended for exactly these issues ~ worsening depression &amp; suicidality, and worse executive functioning. The DSM-5 just opened up dual-diagnosis for AuDHD, so there's plenty we don't know about this combined condition. Not to mention, the variety if comorbidities associated with ASD &amp; ADHD, and the paradoxical medication reactions frequently experienced.

I have massive empathy towards the fact that the system is over-worked, but I do think it's a huge sign of things needing to change when you have lots of people ~ psyche patients themselves ~ raising the alarm bells, losing trust, and saying their meds/treatments harmed them.\n\nFinally, the psychiatric system does have established roots in colonialism and patriarchy. It is important to recognize how this impacts current day understanding &amp; diagnostic tools. This is a far from a resolved issue, as the blame doesn't just lie within individual HCWs but the systems of psychiatry itself ~ from education, to diagnostic tools, the 'body'/regulators of psychiatry, and how we institutionally lock help behind \"deficiency\" as a personal state &amp; not due to situational lack of support.",

I see and hear you, and I understand. I am also struggling with the resultant aftermath of psychiatry, stigma and treatment. \n\nThere is absolutely nothing wrong with the way you were made. The problem is the hateful society that you've been unjustly subjected to. You are loved, and important, and deeply needed in this world. I'm holding your hand with you, albeit virtually. ❤️\n\nPlease my dear, call a helpline as soon as possible.

It's helped me understand mine a little more.\n\n\nI chose where I'm living now for the express reason it is tucked away behind the landlord's home, and there's a small yard for the use of the 4 small rental units that are back here. my noise-canceling headphones are able to filter out most road noise from nearby.\n\n\n*All I wanted to do* was use this yard to pursue learning the behaviors and tools I need to stop being a victim of my trauma, to control it instead. I have *never* been able to meditate, use my telescope, fully enjoy meals outside, do my morning stretches, etc, in this beautiful little yard because my neighbors have a small pack of dogs that is even more ill-behaved than normal.\n\n\nShortly after I moved in I knew there was an issue; I saw how wild and disobedient those dogs were. It's no mystery why. Virtually no one trains their animals anyways, and this pack consists of several small terriers and a young golden lab. The big dog is learning lessons from the smaller ones and was just as vicious-sounding as they were, and as a whole they do not get enough exercise, engagement with the outdoors or socialization.\n\n\nThese two people don't walk their dogs, despite there being one of the largest parks in town directly across the street. They only come outside when they *have* to, when it's convenient for them, or when they have company over. They have never voluntarily gone outside for the pure sake of the dog's well-being, they don't enjoy being outside themselves for the sake of it, why do they own dogs?\n\n\n\nI started out trying to cope, but whenever I was outside they'd harass me, and the owners didn't do anything, and I didn't have the mental resources to undertake the challenge of pulling their heads from their asses. I'm busy enough trying to do that to myself.\n\n\n\nIt came to a climax when I was sitting at the picnic table in the yard, which is over by the fence. I was facing my home, watching a video, eating some gourmet snacks I'd made, pleased with myself for a recent victory.\n\n\nOne of them came outside, and the INSTANT they saw me they charged, shrieking and growling. Before I could even get up they were inches from my back, pushing the fencing against my back. I managed to dash for my door, stammering out, \"I have PTSD!\" in an attempt to get mercy.\n\n\nWell, my nervous system crystallized the event into a new minor trigger. Now almost every dog makes the readout dials of my nervous system bounce up. These people's negligence has contributed to my lifelong mental struggle. \n\n\nThey did make an attempt to train their animals after that, but in a very ineffective way. Negative reinforcement only, no basics of obedience and command. As time has gone on I've had two full emotional flashbacks and had a tantrum at them. The first time was when I was struggling on the 3rd anniversary of my father's death, an event tied into my CPTSD. (He was a victim of my mother as well, not a perpetrator) I was tending my plants, and again, they startled me and triggered an episode before I could get my defenses up.\n\n\nThe second time was just recently. I had a great victory of s problem so stressful that I lost NINE pounds of weight within 36-48 hours when I discovered it's existence earlier that week. I looked forward all day to cooking a salmon dinner, went alllll across town gathering the best ingredients, spent an hour making it, and I'd fasted a little bit that day. Hunger is the best sauce!\n\n\nI forgot to look outside before exiting, something I shouldn't have to do anyways, and one of them was out there with the dogs. I didn't even try to go outside, then. My childhood was defined by not being able to go outside or eat regularly, to the point of mild malnutrition. Being hungry and not being able to eat or feel safe outside triggered me, and I acted like a fool.",

I didn&amp;#39;t even try to go outside, then. My childhood was defined by not being able to go outside or eat regularly, to the point of mild malnutrition. Being hungry and not being able to eat or feel safe outside triggered me, and I acted like a fool.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

And she asked me what prevents me from doing it (expecting me to say for my family or pets, neither of which I have). I said I'm not going to attempt it if it won't be successful and I give myself a brain injury. So I told her I just make sure I don't have access to what I'd need for my plan, because then it'd be too easy to do it when I'm in a bad spot. And her eyes got all big like that was shocking.

And she asked me what prevents me from doing it (expecting me to say for my family or pets, neither of which I have). I said I&amp;#39;m not going to attempt it if it won&amp;#39;t be successful and I give myself a brain injury. So I told her I just make sure I don&amp;#39;t have access to what I&amp;#39;d need for my plan, because then it&amp;#39;d be too easy to do it when I&amp;#39;m in a bad spot. And her eyes got all big like that was shocking. I guess for people who&amp;#39;ve gone through what we have, that&amp;#39;s not shocking to me at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

Everyone thought I was mature for my age. An old soul. Angelic. Wise beyond my years. But the truth? I was already dissociating.\n\nSee, they called it brilliance. But really, I was just emotionally parentless. My mom and dad fought like animals behind closed doors, then dressed me in silk and paraded me around like a trophy. My dad gave me the world—quit his job the day I was born to raise me, picked me up from school in a Ferrari, took me around the globe before I could spell my own name.. but it was never for me. It was for the story. The image. The proof that he could be something better. But he was a nervous man. A drinker. A controller. And I was just the plus-one to his chaos.\n\nI had my first breakdown at seven. On the way to Egypt. I remember sobbing in the car to the airport while he screamed about delays and passports. Travel wasn’t freedom; it was pressure. When my parents finally split after years of alcoholism and screaming matches, he took full custody. My mom disappeared into her own bottle. He had divorced his third, previous wife just to make me. I was his legacy. His redemption arc. His anchor. And that anchor got dragged across the ocean floor.\n\nHe took me to almost 90 countries–Kurdistan, Djibouti, North Korea, and border zones most people wouldn’t walk through sober. But we weren’t sober. That’s the kicker. The further we went, the harder we drank. Caribbean cruises turned into floating benders. Africa was a blur of cheap beer and panic attacks. Women threw stones at me for showing skin because my dad never saw a problem with parading his teenage daughter through conservaitive war-zones in hotpants. I was too young to process the danger, too scared to say no, too broken to know I should.\n\nHe never hit me. He just never saw me.\n\nAnd that’s the trick, isn’t it? When your parents were monsters, the world understands. But when they were charismatic, extravagant, and ever-present? No one believes you were starving.\n\nBecause emotional neglect with a credit card looks like privilege.\n\nI was a princess in a palace built from chaos. And now I’m an adult who swings from fog to mania to existential collapse like a goddamn pendulum with rusty gears.\\\nI don’t switch personalities.\\\nI fracture\\\ngently.\\\nI'll snarl like a rogue with strangers, then talk like I'm 5 the second I feel safe. And then I vanish again into silence because that’s what my nervous system calls home.\n\nSometimes I get productive. Hyper-productive. Dancing-in-the-kitchen, babbling-at-my-roommate, burning-a-hole-in-my-notebook productive. And then I crash. Because I’m not bipolar. I’m just rewiring a brain that was never wired for peace.\n\nAnd I’ve had enough of the guilt.\\\nThe *why am I like this* spiral.\\\nThe *I didn’t get beaten so I shouldn’t be broken* spiral.\n\nHere’s the gospel, straight from the gutter:\n\n**Not all trauma comes with bruises. Some comes with luxury. Some comes with tailored dresses and black-car service. Some comes with parents who smile and kiss your forehead before handing you a drink.**\\\nAnd just because it looked like love doesn’t mean it felt like safety.\n\nSo no, I’m not a brat.\\\nI’m a fucking relic of ornamental dysfunction.\n\nI’m not lazy. I’m frozen.\\\nI’m not dramatic. I’m drowning.\\\nI’m not spoiled. I’m haunted.\n\nThis isn’t a sob story. It’s scripture\\\nTattoo it across your ribs if you need a reminder:\n\n**I made it out of a palace of glass with bare feet and broken teeth.**\\\nAnd I’m still crawling toward the truth.\n\nThis is my gospel. And I’ll scream it from the sewer.\\\nUntil the world learns to see kids like me.\n",

What about someone who has complex trauma and ADHD? ADHD often comes with impulsivity and difficulty with anger and rejection sensitivity. How would you differentiate that from BPD?\n\n2. Does someone with ANY harmful behavior to self or desire to self-harm or die automatically be considered BPD as opppses to c-PTSD? Why can't someone trying to cope with the complex-PTSD be suicidal or self-injurous without it being a different diagnosis?\n\n3. They show one difference is interpersonal relationships. As someone who was late diagnosed with autism AND taken off my ADHD meds in childhood, a lot of trauma came from interpersonal relationships, and a lot of people genuinely DO abandon someone with trauma, and a lot of folks with c-PTSD had parents or family abandon them. Having a fear of abandonment makes sense in this case for anyone as it is based on the reality of what people actually did. Why would any rational person in this situation NOT fear abandonment without it being a different disorder?\n\n4. The last big difference seems to be the sense of self. This one kind of makes sense as a differentiation, but it also makes sense to me that someone with complex trauma who goes through periods of finding things they are strong in or good at and a strong sense of community or maybe gets involved in volunteer work would start to have a better sense of self, but then if those things are for some reason taken away from them, they are left to feel lost again. That also seems rational to me.\n\nOther than these things, they overlap in basically all other symptoms, but hopefully someone can answer these questions for me.",

                "selftext": "I have essentially lived my entire life ever since I was a preteen under this belief that I am fundamentally a horrible, destructive, and abusive person who would have been better off not being alive. I have extremely severe self-esteem and general identity issues, extreme anxiety/obsessive-compulsive thinking, seemingly untreatable depression, deep-rooted perfectionism, an incredibly heightened emotional sensitivity &amp; incredibly lowered capacity to regulate said emotions, and have struggled to make any meaningful, healthy, or long-lasting connections to other human beings for my entire life.\n\nI did not grow up in a physically, emotionally, or sexually abusive household. In fact, I remember living in a household that would be ideal for most. I remember my mother showering me with love and giving me everything I ever wanted. I do not remember her ever hitting me, ever saying anything demeaning to me, or touching me inappropriately.\n\nThis is what I generally remember from the first 8 years of my life. I had the occasional temper tantrum, and I did not like it when she put me in certain extracurricular activities I had no talent or interest in, but these were mild at worst.\n\n# \n\nThen suddenly, when I was 9, everything suddenly changed. I did have one thing happen at school--i made a friend, and then had a falling out with him. This, for some reason, caused a dramatic character shift in me. I became extremely emotionally unstable, resulting in several uncontrollable emotional meltdowns/episodes both at school and at home. At school, other kids would tease me and attempt to bait me into having an episode, and as a result of this many of my meltdowns at school became increasingly violent.\n\nI think that some of my memories around this period of time are outright false, or did not happen. I know that there are some memories I have which did not happen, and I think that it applies to this period the most. It's not that I think I wasn't bullied, or didn't have episodes, but I think that the things I've told myself about these memories for years might not be fully accurate, and there's some things which I outright cannot remember despite remembering them in some ways.\n\nI wanted to run away from home (although I never did), I started using a fake name on school assignments because I hated my real name, I started fantasizing that my entire life was fake and that I was in some kind of coma or that I was in hell and didn't know it, I started to internalize this idea that I existed to be a scapegoat for the other children in my class and that my existence acted as a magnet to their \"weirdness\" so that they could all be normal and happy while I had to be the \"weird kid\".\n\nThese feelings, of extreme emotions dysfunction towards both myself and towards others, continued for about 4 years as I moved from elementary school to middle school. My mother had been putting me in significant psychiatric care during this time, going on several different medications, going to many different therapists and therapy groups for children, etcetera. None of them really managed to figure out what was wrong with me beyond depression.\n\nEventually, after my violent behavior increased at home and I was making suicidal gestures, I was placed in a psych ward around the time I was 13 and a half which was extremely traumatizing--despite lasting less than a week. It was a form of solitary confinement where I was left locked in a dark room for hours on end, only to be let out a few times during the day for meal times and brief recesses. There was no therapy. After I was let free the episodes completely stopped, although I would start living in a state of sever emotional repression and constant, conscious self-loathing where every bad thing I had ever done would haunt me.\n\n# \n\nI have essentially lived my entire life in this state of perpetual guilt and self-loathing for everything that I have done, everything that I have been. And the worst part is, I did it without having any severe trauma! I was just fucking BORN this way and suddenly started acting insane for NO reason whatsoever. With all of my different therapists and psychiatrists and everything that I have done the one thing that I have had to internalize deeply, from all of the adults around me, is the idea that there is something fundamentally wrong with me that cannot be fixed, and that the best I can do is simply learn to accommodate to my problems because they're never going to go away. I was always frustrated with therapists for focusing more on how to deal with things in the moment rather than get to the core of my problems. But that's because there is no core! There is no hidden trauma that I just repressed! There is no secret abuse that I just forgot about! It's all me! It's all fucking me! I am the problem!

                "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have essentially lived my entire life ever since I was a preteen under this belief that I am fundamentally a horrible, destructive, and abusive person who would have been better off not being alive. I have extremely severe self-esteem and general identity issues, extreme anxiety/obsessive-compulsive thinking, seemingly untreatable depression, deep-rooted perfectionism, an incredibly heightened emotional sensitivity &amp;amp; incredibly lowered capacity to regulate said emotions, and have struggled to make any meaningful, healthy, or long-lasting connections to other human beings for my entire life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I did not grow up in a physically, emotionally, or sexually abusive household. In fact, I remember living in a household that would be ideal for most. I remember my mother showering me with love and giving me everything I ever wanted. I do not remember her ever hitting me, ever saying anything demeaning to me, or touching me inappropriately.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is what I generally remember from the first 8 years of my life. I had the occasional temper tantrum, and I did not like it when she put me in certain extracurricular activities I had no talent or interest in, but these were mild at worst.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then suddenly, when I was 9, everything suddenly changed. I did have one thing happen at school--i made a friend, and then had a falling out with him. This, for some reason, caused a dramatic character shift in me. I became extremely emotionally unstable, resulting in several uncontrollable emotional meltdowns/episodes both at school and at home. At school, other kids would tease me and attempt to bait me into having an episode, and as a result of this many of my meltdowns at school became increasingly violent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think that some of my memories around this period of time are outright false, or did not happen. I know that there are some memories I have which did not happen, and I think that it applies to this period the most. It&amp;#39;s not that I think I wasn&amp;#39;t bullied, or didn&amp;#39;t have episodes, but I think that the things I&amp;#39;ve told myself about these memories for years might not be fully accurate, and there&amp;#39;s some things which I outright cannot remember despite remembering them in some ways.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wanted to run away from home (although I never did), I started using a fake name on school assignments because I hated my real name, I started fantasizing that my entire life was fake and that I was in some kind of coma or that I was in hell and didn&amp;#39;t know it, I started to internalize this idea that I existed to be a scapegoat for the other children in my class and that my existence acted as a magnet to their &amp;quot;weirdness&amp;quot; so that they could all be normal and happy while I had to be the &amp;quot;weird kid&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These feelings, of extreme emotions dysfunction towards both myself and towards others, continued for about 4 years as I moved from elementary school to middle school. My mother had been putting me in significant psychiatric care during this time, going on several different medications, going to many different therapists and therapy groups for children, etcetera. None of them really managed to figure out what was wrong with me beyond depression.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Eventually, after my violent behavior increased at home and I was making suicidal gestures, I was placed in a psych ward around the time I was 13 and a half which was extremely traumatizing--despite lasting less than a week. It was a form of solitary confinement where I was left locked in a dark room for hours on end, only to be let out a few times during the day for meal times and brief recesses. There was no therapy. After I was let free the episodes completely stopped, although I would start living in a state of sever emotional repression and constant, conscious self-loathing where every bad thing I had ever done would haunt me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have essentially lived my entire life in this state of perpetual guilt and self-loathing for everything that I have done, everything that I have been. And the worst part is, I did it without having any severe trauma! I was just fucking BORN this way and suddenly started acting insane for NO reason whatsoever. With all of my different therapists and psychiatrists and everything that I have done the one thing that I have had to internalize deeply, from all of the adults around me, is the idea that there is something fundamentally wrong with me that cannot be fixed, and that the best I can do is simply learn to accommodate to my problems because they&amp;#39;re never going to go away. I was always frustrated with therapists for focusing more on how to deal with things in the moment rather than get to the core of my problems. But that&amp;#39;s because there is no core! There is no hidden trauma that I just repressed! There is no secret abuse that I just forgot about! It&amp;#39;s all me! It&amp;#39;s all fucking me! I am the problem! I am the one who ruined my family and gave my sister trauma! I am the one who is responsible for everything and unlike everyone else that&amp;#39;s not just a trauma response--that&amp;#39;s ACTUALLY what happened! I actually AM a shitty person and my parents actually WERE just victims to me! How do I live with that? How do I live knowing that I am a fundamentally broken person and that it&amp;#39;s no one&amp;#39;s fault that I&amp;#39;m fucked up other than myself, and my own blood?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There was a period of time where I was obsessed with the idea of my mother having molested me but there&amp;#39;s no actual proof or evidence or memories of that beyond just my own masochistic wish-fulfillment of having lived a shittier life than I actually did because I thought that I deserved it! I don&amp;#39;t get an easy out of being uncontrollably hostile and violent because I lived in a physically abusive household or whatever, I just was because I fundamentally am that way and I cannot be fixed. I have all of the symptoms of C-PTSD not because I was traumatized by any of the adults in my life but because I traumatized myself.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

I am NOT asking for a diagnosis, I&amp;#39;m going to therapy and getting a diagnosis through a psychologist, but I want to know if its worth going that route. Does this sound like something that should flag me for C-PTSD?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

I feel a really huge weight lifted off of me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I’ve wanted to like full send it and unfollow everyone and delete pictures. But they genuinely don’t understand. they would all be very hurt, and those friendships will never be repaired.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have a new job and I feel really confident there. I’m making friends. There’s some very attractive men working there and I’m actually going for it and putting myself out there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know the whole “don’t shit where you eat” but it’s the only place I go. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I need so much space from everyone. Literally everyone. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

I’m struggling a lot and I feel so invalidated since it happened so long ago at the start…\n\nApologies for the long post, please someone read this and help me, I don’t even know what to think…\n\nI’m 20 now, but 8 years ago when I was 12 I played a lot of Xbox and talked to people in online games. I met someone online, she was 17 years old, but super nice to me and cute and made me feel special. We started to date and it only lasted probably 7-8 months, I struggle to even call it date because I was young and it was just sending heart texts or playing games in voice chat together. I don’t remember a lot of it, and we never sent pictures or did anything sexual then, but I do remember her often saying how she loved I was so mature, and she’d call me hot a few times but I never really knew how to respond, but I was happy. Eventually, I guess she got tired of me or didn’t like me any more (in therapy I’ve learned to heavily expect she has BPD, but that’s another topic) and she blocked and left me with no explanation.\n\nAbout 5 years later, I was 15 and she was 20, she reached out to me again on her own and said she wanted to talk. We talked for a while and eventually she said she missed me a lot, and I stupidly let her back in, I know it was wrong but I was a child and I idolized her :( \n\nIt was not a great relationship, she was very emotionally and verbally abusive towards be, and also very hyper-sexual, including dating someone else and trying to convince me it’s “polyamory” (while the other person didn’t even know, I was young and an idiot I’m so sorry). We again were long distance so nothing physical, but I’d sent her sexual pictures but she never wanted to send anything back. We’d have “e-sex” or masturbate on call or text, I know it was wrong and I’m so sorry I let it happen, but I was dumb and young and it made me feel happy and wanted…\n\nShe would always say how “maternal” she was and wanted kids, and she’d mention how she “loved our age gap”, or when I’d get flustered or stutter on my words she’d say how she “wanted to take advantage of me”. It made me feel special and loved at the time but always a little confused I guess, she loved when I called her mommy too…\n\nEventually as expected, she blocked and left me with little explanation after about a year, I think she met someone else but I really don’t know. After another 4 years, I was 19 and she was 24, she contacted me again and like the stupid fucking idiot I am I let her back in…\n\nMy parents didn’t like her, my friends didn’t like her, but I was just happy to see her again. All the breakups in the past she’d always make it a point that it’s “my fault” and I need to “work on myself and fix my issues”, I’m not perfect but I tried so hard to love her and be enough even if it meant I was a doormat for her, but I was never enough.\n\nThis relationship lasted about 1.5 years and she broke up with me about 3 weeks ago. It was a very emotionally abusive relationship and I was always the one at fault, always the bad one, even though she would always be mean to me or take days or hours of space over tiny inconveniences, but again that’s not the point of this post. We finally met up quite a few times in person this relationship, obviously there were sexual things happened, and she’d say the same things like she loved our age gap or she wanted me to make her a mom or how she wanted to take advantage of me. I guess I’m naturally sort of submissive and I liked it but it still felt weird, I guess we were both legal though so I just assumed I was being soft and childish and ignored my worries. As expected, about 3 weeks ago, after days of her cussing me out or calling me awful and manipulative and smearing my name to friends, she blocked me and left me with no words again…\n\nNow that’s she’s broken up with me, I’m in therapy and I’m not doing so well, I was so attached to her for years and even though I know how toxic and awful she was, I idolized this woman for nearly half my life since I was 11-12 and had always assumed everything was my fault and that she was perfect.  I’m struggling dealing with the weight of all this realization hitting me at once…\n\nDid this sound like grooming :(? Am I invalidated because I dated her again when I was finally legal?\n\nI’m so sorry, I just don’t know how to process these emotions and I don’t even know what to think, please please help me.\n\nI feel stupid, like I shouldn’t let grooming affect me now that I’m older, that I don’t deserve to talk about it…",

I’m struggling dealing with the weight of all this realization hitting me at once…&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Did this sound like grooming :(? Am I invalidated because I dated her again when I was finally legal?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I’m so sorry, I just don’t know how to process these emotions and I don’t even know what to think, please please help me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I feel stupid, like I shouldn’t let grooming affect me now that I’m older, that I don’t deserve to talk about it…&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

I think I was triggered while dreaming and woke up in flashback. \n\nSince I'm actively trying to establish a set of habits and structures in my day-to-day, I'm now noticing how this one day of zero prefrontal cortex action uprooted every single habit I had put in place! \n\nBefore, I would put a habit in place and after some adjustment I would be able to just glide smoothly through the day, doing all the things without having to give it much thought. A perfect way to avoid decision fatigue and feel some peace. \n\nNow I feel like I'm back to square one. Like I have to re-invent even the most basic algorithms of the everyday. I forget things I used to do every day for months. I just don't remember how to go about it, or I'm doing the thing that comes after it first. And I have to start all the habits up from zero now! I have to go through the whole decision process and the whole process of trying to motivate myself for the first few times until it becomes automatic, a habit. \n\nIn one way I'm fortunate to be able to witness my dysfunction like this - to be able to make sense of it. Took me years of therapy to get here. \n\nBut I'm very angry now! It explains why I always felt my life's structure was like a house of cards, flimsy and in danger of being blown over any minute. And it takes huge amounts of energy to establish such structures from scratch! \n\nIt messes up my sense of security and my sense of who I am, what I'm capable of. \n\nThanks for listening to my rant and have a nice day.

Everything foggy, time made no sense. I think I was triggered while dreaming and woke up in flashback. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since I&amp;#39;m actively trying to establish a set of habits and structures in my day-to-day, I&amp;#39;m now noticing how this one day of zero prefrontal cortex action uprooted every single habit I had put in place! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Before, I would put a habit in place and after some adjustment I would be able to just glide smoothly through the day, doing all the things without having to give it much thought. A perfect way to avoid decision fatigue and feel some peace. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now I feel like I&amp;#39;m back to square one. Like I have to re-invent even the most basic algorithms of the everyday. I forget things I used to do every day for months. I just don&amp;#39;t remember how to go about it, or I&amp;#39;m doing the thing that comes after it first. And I have to start all the habits up from zero now! I have to go through the whole decision process and the whole process of trying to motivate myself for the first few times until it becomes automatic, a habit. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In one way I&amp;#39;m fortunate to be able to witness my dysfunction like this - to be able to make sense of it. Took me years of therapy to get here. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I&amp;#39;m very angry now! It explains why I always felt my life&amp;#39;s structure was like a house of cards, flimsy and in danger of being blown over any minute. And it takes huge amounts of energy to establish such structures from scratch! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It messes up my sense of security and my sense of who I am, what I&amp;#39;m capable of. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks for listening to my rant and have a nice day. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
